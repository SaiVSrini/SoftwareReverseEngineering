ðŸ“– What is RegDropMap?
    RegDropMap is a lightweight forensic tool that parses RegShot diff files, identifies registry-based persistence mechanisms, and visualizes the dropped file paths linked to registry keys. It helps forensic analysts, malware researchers, and security professionals:
  1.Detect suspicious persistence techniques.
  2.Map malwareâ€™s registry-to-file behaviors.
  3.Identify dropped files in unusual locations (like Temp, AppData, etc.)
  4.Automate tedious manual analysis of large registry diffs.
