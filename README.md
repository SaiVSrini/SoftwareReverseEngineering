ðŸ“– What is RegDropMap?
RegDropMap is a lightweight forensic tool that parses RegShot diff files, identifies registry-based persistence mechanisms, and visualizes the dropped file paths linked to registry keys.

It helps forensic analysts, malware researchers, and security professionals:

Detect suspicious persistence techniques.

Map malwareâ€™s registry-to-file behaviors.

Identify dropped files in unusual locations (like Temp, AppData, etc.)

Automate tedious manual analysis of large registry diffs.
